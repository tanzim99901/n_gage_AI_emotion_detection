We developed an AI-based automatic emotion detection system that detects productive and unproductive engagement during online live teamwork sessions. We use three data streams from an interactive session: audio, video, and text. We automatically analyze them and determine each teamâ€™s level of engagement, such as productive engagement, unproductive engagement, disengagement, and idle. The AI-based system was validated based on hand-coded data. We used the system to characterize productive and unproductive engagement patterns in teams. The results show that the system effectively detects engagement and can be a viable tool for characterizing productive and unproductive engagement patterns in teamwork sessions.
